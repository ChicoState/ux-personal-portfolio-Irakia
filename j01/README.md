# Title: Spotify navigating music recommendations 
 By Ahmad Iraki 3/26 

 Like many people, I use Spotify to browse, play, and find new music however recently they have changed an integral feature of the system by which you like and save music previous to this change the way it would work is you could either click a save to playlist button or click a heart-shaped button to favorite a song this is a pretty common **convention** layout wise you can find a similar favorite feature in many apps for media, while also having the button in a shape of a heart gives it a lot of **Affordance**
